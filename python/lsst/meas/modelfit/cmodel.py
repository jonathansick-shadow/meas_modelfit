    The CModel algorithm currently cannot be run in forced mode when the measurement WCS is different
    from the reference WCS (as is the case in CCD forced photometry).  This is a temporary limitation
    that will be addressed on DM-5405.

    CModel forced measurement when the measurement image is the same as the reference image should be
    almost -- but not quite -- identical to unforced measurement.  The primary difference is that
    the final fit region from the reference measurement will be used for the initial fit in forced mode
    as well as the exp, dev, and combined exp+dev fits
